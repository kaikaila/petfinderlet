**INFO 253A Project Proposal**

**Team name**: MACY - Anita Guo, Casey Hou, Michelle Lin, Yunkai Li

**Title**: Animal Adoption App

**Functionality**: A React-based front-end web app where users can explore adoptable pets based on specific criteria, using data from the Petfinder API. Users can search for animals by type (dog, cat, etc.), breed, age, size, and location. The platform can also allow users to “favorite” pets they’re interested in and want to revisit later, making it easier to keep track of options. The list of favorite pets will be stored in localStorage, ensuring the list persists across sessions.

API: [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/). The Petfinder API offers comprehensive access to a large database of adoptable animals, including information on the pets' breed, age, size, gender, and specific shelter details. And it’s FREE!
